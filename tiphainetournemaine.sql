The book is also sought by the evil scientist Skagra, who has developed a sphere capable of drawing its victims'' minds out of their bodies. Skagra needs the book to reach the Time Lord prison Shada, which even the Time Lords have forgotten. Long ago they imprisoned the criminal Salyavin there, as punishment for using his powers to transfer his mind into other people''s bodies. Chronotis is eventually forced to admit that he himself is Salyavin; he escaped long ago and used his powers to cause the Time Lords to forget about his prison. However, he''s now repented of his crimes and wishes to live a quiet, peaceful life. Skagra drains Chronotis''s mind and thus acquires the ability to transfer his own mind into other bodies; with the aid of the sphere and his crystalline servants, the Krargs, he will spread his own mind throughout the Universe and become immortal. However, when the Doctor pretends to be stupid, the sphere fails to drain his mind completely. He thus survives, and since there''s a copy of his mind inside the sphere, he is able to use the resonance to turn Skagra''s possessed slaves against him. Skagra is imprisoned by his own Ship, and Chronotis returns to Earth to resume his peaceful retirement.</p>', 21, 17, '0000-00-00', NULL, 'http://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/323325/doctor-who-17x21-shada-part-one'),

5.3&nbsp;!<br>Nommée «&nbsp;Kirk&nbsp;» en l&rsquo;honneur du multi-instrumentaliste de jazz Rahsaan Roland Kirk, la dernière version de WordPress est disponible en téléchargement.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id="more-1493"></span>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/divider.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1497" srcset="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/divider.png 768w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/divider-300x76.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>5.3 développe et affine l’éditeur introduit dans WordPress 5.0 avec un nouveau bloc, des interactions plus intuitives et une accessibilité améliorée.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les nouvelles fonctionnalités de l’éditeur augmentent la liberté de conception, fournissent des options de mise en page supplémentaires et des variations de styles permettant aux concepteurs de contrôler totalement l’apparence de leur site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cette version introduit également le thème Twenty Twenty, offrant à l’utilisateur plus de flexibilité de conception et d’intégration avec l&rsquo;éditeur. Créer de belles pages web et des mises en page avancées n’a jamais été aussi simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Des améliorations de l’éditeur de blocs et de l&rsquo;ergonomie du back- office</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls muted src="https://wordpress.org/news/files/2019/11/navigation.mp4"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cette mise à jour focalisée sur les améliorations introduit plus de 150 nouvelles fonctionnalités et améliorations d’utilisabilité, comme la prise en charge des grandes images pour téléverser les images de haute résolution prises avec votre téléphone ou avec d’autre appareils de haute résolution. En combinaison avec l’utilisation de tailles d’images plus larges, vos photos seront le mieux traitées possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les améliorations d’accessibilité incluent l’intégration des styles de l’éditeur dans l’interface d’administration. Ces améliorations corrigent de nombreux problèmes d’accessibilité&nbsp;: contrastes des couleurs sur les champs de formulaires et sur les boutons, cohérence entre l’éditeur et les écrans d’administration, nouvelles notices affichées à la volée, standardisation du jeu de couleurs par défaut de WordPress, et l’introduction d’animations pour rendre l’interaction avec les blocs plus élégante et naturelle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour les personnes utilisant un clavier pour naviguer sur l’administration, l’éditeur dispose maintenant d’un mode de navigation. Cela permet de sauter d’un bloc à l’autre sans tabuler à travers l’ensemble des éléments de chaque bloc.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Une flexibilité de conception étendue</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.3 ajoute des outils toujours plus robustes pour concevoir de beaux sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Le nouveau bloc Groupe vous permet de diviser facilement votre page en sections colorées</li><li>Le bloc des colonnes prend maintenant en charge les largeurs fixes de colonnes</li><li>Les nouvelles mises en page prédéfinies transforment en jeu d&rsquo;enfant l’organisation du contenu dans des conceptions avancées</li><li>Le bloc Titre dispose maintenant d’un sélecteur de couleur de texte</li><li>Des options de style supplémentaires vous permettent de définir votre style préféré pour n&rsquo;importe quel bloc qui prend en charge cette fonctionnalité</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Arrivée de Twenty Twenty</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/twentytwenty-desktop.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1498" srcset="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/twentytwenty-desktop.png 768w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/twentytwenty-desktop-300x297.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-medium"><img src="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/twentytwenty-mobile-267x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1499" srcset="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/twentytwenty-mobile-267x300.png 267w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/twentytwenty-mobile.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Le nouvel éditeur fêtant son premier anniversaire, il est appréciable que l’idée directrice de Twenty Twenty soit la flexibilité. Montrez vos services ou vos produits avec des combinaisons de colonnes, de groupes et de blocs médias. Mettez en place vos contenus en grande ou même pleine largeur pour des mises en page dynamiques et attirantes… ou laissez vos réflexions prendre toute la place avec une simple colonne de contenu centrée&nbsp;!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce thème nommé «&nbsp;Twenty Twenty&nbsp;» le mérite bien&nbsp;: la clarté et la lisibilité sont aussi de grandes priorités. Le thème inclut la police&nbsp;<a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a>, conçue par Rasmus Andersson. «&nbsp;Inter&nbsp;» est implémentée sous la forme d’une police variable, une première pour un thème par défaut. Cela améliore les temps de chargement car cette police contient toutes les tailles et toutes les variations de styles en seulement deux fichiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improvements for Everyone</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rotation automatique des images</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-thumbnail is-resized"><img src="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/Rotate-150x150.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1501" width="75" height="75" srcset="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/Rotate-150x150.png 150w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/Rotate.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 75px) 100vw, 75px" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Vos images seront correctement orientées lors du téléversement en fonction des données d’orientation embarquées dans le fichier. Cette fonctionnalité a été proposée pour la première fois il y a neuf ans, et son implémentation a été rendue possible grâce à la persévérance de plusieurs contributrices et contributeurs passionné·e·s.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vérifications de l’état de santé du site</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-thumbnail is-resized"><img src="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/Health-150x150.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1507" width="75" height="75" srcset="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/Health-150x150.png 150w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/Health.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 75px) 100vw, 75px" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Les améliorations introduites dans 5.3 rendent encore plus facile l’identification des problèmes. Les recommandations qui nécessiteraient un dépannage sont mises en avant sur l’écran «&nbsp;Santé de votre site&nbsp;».</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vérification de l’e-mail d’administration</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-thumbnail is-resized"><img src="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/Email-150x150.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1508" width="75" height="75" srcset="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/Email-150x150.png 150w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/Email.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 75px) 100vw, 75px" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Il vous sera dorénavant périodiquement demandé de confirmer que votre adresse de messagerie est à jour quand vous vous connectez en tant qu’administrateur. Cela réduit le risque de verrouillage sans pouvoir accéder à votre site si vous changez d’adresse de messagerie.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pour les développeuses et les développeurs</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Correctifs sur le composant date/heure</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Les développeurs et développeuses peuvent maintenant mieux travailler avec les&nbsp;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/09/23/date-time-improvements-wp-5-3/">dates et fuseaux horaires</a>. La fonctionnalité de gestion de la date et de l’heure a reçue quantité de nouvelles fonctions API pour unifier l’utilisation des fuseaux horaires, pour améliorer l’intéropérabilité PHP ainsi que plusieurs correctifs et améliorations diverses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Compatibilité PHP 7.4</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.3 vise à prendre en charge totalement PHP 7.4. Cette version contient de&nbsp;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/10/11/wordpress-and-php-7-4/">multiples modifications</a>&nbsp;pour retirer les fonctionnalités dépréciées et assurer la compatibilité. WordPress continue d’encourager ses utilisatrices et utilisateurs à faire tourner leurs sites sur la dernière et la meilleure version de PHP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous cherchez des informations plus techniques sur les évolutions de WordPress 5.3, n&rsquo;oubliez pas de <a href="https://fr.wordpress.org/2019/10/24/les-changements-a-venir-dans-wordpress-5-3/">consulter notre article dédié</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/divider.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1497" srcset="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/divider.png 768w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/divider-300x76.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>L&rsquo;équipe derrière WP 5.3</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cette version de WordPress a été coordonnée par <a href="http://ma.tt/">Matt Mullenweg</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/francina">Francesca Marano</a> et&nbsp;<a href="https://dream-encode.com/blog/">David Baumwald</a>.

Plusieurs sources sont alors proposées : les sources officieuses comme les articles de blogs, et les sources officielles. Elles sont simples à identifier puisqu&rsquo;elles utilisent le domaine <code>WordPress.org</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deux types de sources officielles co-existent actuellement dans les résultats de recherche : l&rsquo;ancien <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/">Codex</a>, et <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org">DevHub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Le codex c&rsquo;est terminé, place à DevHub&nbsp;!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Depuis maintenant quelques années, une migration a été lancée vers la nouvelle plateforme de référence pour la documentation de WordPress&nbsp;: surnommée «&nbsp;DevHub&nbsp;», <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org">developer.wordpress.org</a> a pour vocation de remplacer totalement l&rsquo;ancien Codex.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pourquoi changer&nbsp;?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Basé sur un Wiki (une encyclopédie modifiable), le Codex avait l&rsquo;avantage (et l&rsquo;inconvénient) d&rsquo;avoir un contenu intégralement généré par ses utilisatrices et utilisateurs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avantages, car il n&rsquo;y avait pas de limite à la création de pages de documentation et cela permettait à tout un chacun de proposer des contributions, des exemples, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inconvénients, car il était alors quasiment impossible de maintenir à jour cette documentation. Les fonctionnalités de WordPress évoluent rapidement, au rythme de généralement 3 nouvelles versions majeures par an et une dizaine de versions mineures. Il est très difficile de tenir la documentation de ces fonctionnalités à jour avec quelques dizaines de volontaires. Ainsi, le Codex est condamné à une certaine obsolescence, le volume de contribution des nouvelles pages de documentation ne pouvant suivre le volume d&rsquo;évolutions au sein du CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DevHub, vers une documentation semi-automatisée</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Au contraire du Codex, la nouvelle plateforme de référence DevHub – <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org">developer.wordpress.org</a> – fonctionne de façon automatisée (ou presque).</p>\n\n\n\n<p style="background-color:#04598a;color:#ffffff" class="has-text-color has-background has-medium-font-size">Sur DevHub, la documentation des fonctions, crochets (hooks), filtres et autres actions est générée automatiquement à partir de la documentation présente dans les fichiers du cœur du CMS.<br><strong>Cette documentation est donc toujours 100% à jour par rapport au cœur WP.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour le coup, l&rsquo;avantage est clair&nbsp;: <strong>dès la sortie d&rsquo;une nouvelle version de WordPress, l&rsquo;ensemble de la documentation est automatiquement mis à jour</strong> pour intégrer les nouvelles fonctionnalités, comprenant les pages de documentation existantes comme la création de nouvelles pages pour les nouvelles fonctionnalités.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;inconvénient que l&rsquo;on peut y voir est un format plus rigide que l&rsquo;ancien Codex. Même si cela a clairement des avantages en terme de rapidité de l&rsquo;accès à l&rsquo;information vu que tout est formaté de la même façon, cela aura peut-être pour certain·e·s un peu moins de charme que le bon vieux Codex et ses pages générées à l&rsquo;huile de coude <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Le codex progressivement redirigé vers DevHub</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Les pages du Codex seront progressivement redirigées de façon permanente vers DevHub (c&rsquo;est déjà le cas pour beaucoup d&rsquo;entre elles). D&rsquo;ici là, faites attention :</p>\n\n\n\n<p style="background-color:#04598a;color:#ffffff" class="has-text-color has-background has-medium-font-size"><strong>Les contenus du Codex ne sont plus maintenus</strong> et proposent donc une documentation incomplète ou obsolète. <br>Il est fortement recommandé d&rsquo;utiliser la documentation proposée sur developer.wordpress.org <strong>qui est maintenant la seule documentation officielle de WordPress à jour</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bien sûr, les pages du Codex étant progressivement redirigées vers DevHub, nous sommes dans une période de transition pendant laquelle les deux co-existent. Forts d&rsquo;une grande notoriété, les pages du Codex apparaissent souvent avant les pages DevHub dans les résultats de recherche. Mais cela sera résolu au fur et à mesure de la redirection permanente des pages vers DevHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/codex-devhub.png"><img src="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/codex-devhub-1024x406.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1432" srcset="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/codex-devhub-1024x406.png 1024w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/codex-devhub-300x119.png 300w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/codex-devhub-768x304.png 768w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/codex-devhub.png 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Comment lire une page de documentation sur DevHub</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Prenons par exemple une fonction de base de WP au hasard&nbsp;:&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_the_time/"><code>get_the_time()</code></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sur la fiche developer.w.org, on retrouvera plusieurs sections :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Le&nbsp;<strong>nom</strong>&nbsp;de la fonction</li><li>Une&nbsp;<strong>description courte</strong></li><li>Une&nbsp;<strong>description longue</strong>&nbsp;(quand c&rsquo;est nécessaire)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-1.png"><img src="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1433" srcset="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-1.png 737w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-1-300x50.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Les&nbsp;<strong>paramètres d’entrée</strong>&nbsp;de la fonction :</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-2.png"><img src="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1434" srcset="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-2.png 710w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-2-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Les éléments&nbsp;<strong>retournés</strong>&nbsp;par la fonction (si la fonction est sensée retourner quelque chose) :</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-3.png"><img src="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1435" srcset="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-3.png 782w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-3-300x47.png 300w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-3-768x120.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>La&nbsp;<strong>source</strong>&nbsp;de la fonction dans le cœur WordPress, avec les éléments suivants :<ul><li>Le fichier dans lequel la fonction est déclarée (lien cliquable vers la liste de toutes les fonctions déclarées dans ce fichier).</li><li>Le code de la fonction.</li><li>Un bouton permettant de voir le code source en entier.</li><li>Un lien «&nbsp;View on Trac&nbsp;» pour voir la fonction au sein du fichier où elle est déclarée sur Trac, sur le dépôt du code source de WordPress.</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-4.png"><img src="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1436" srcset="https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-4.png 989w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-4-300x113.png 300w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-4-768x289.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 989px) 100vw, 989px" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Le&nbsp;<strong>changelog</strong>&nbsp;: il s’agit de la liste des différentes modifications faites sur la fonction et de la version de WordPress correspondant à chaque modification.

Si cela se passe en votre absence (via une mise à jour automatique par exemple) alors vous recevrez un e-mail contenant des informations sur le bug rencontré et sur le fait que votre site est passé en <em>mode de récupération</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour en savoir plus, vous pouvez consulter cet article (en anglais) : </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="g5hchqhLg4"><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/fatal-error-recovery-mode-in-5-2/">Fatal Error Recovery Mode in 5.2</a></blockquote><iframe title="&#8220;Fatal Error Recovery Mode in 5.2&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" src="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/fatal-error-recovery-mode-in-5-2/embed/#?secret=g5hchqhLg4" data-secret="g5hchqhLg4" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Arrêt de la prise en charge des versions de PHP obsolètes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>À partir de WordPress 5.2, le CMS ne sera plus compatible avec les versions de PHP inférieures à 5.6.20. Si vous utilisez une version de PHP antérieure, vous ne pourrez tout simplement pas réaliser la mise à jour vers WordPress 5.2.

En dehors des optimisations de performances et d&rsquo;utilisabilité, citons notamment l&rsquo;ajout d&rsquo;un module <code>block-editor</code> réutilisable pour permettre l&rsquo;utilisation de l&rsquo;éditeur de façon indépendante de l&rsquo;éditeur de publications, sans dépendance vis à vis des publications. Cela permettra de pouvoir l&rsquo;utiliser dans d&rsquo;autres écrans de l&rsquo;administration WordPress, comme par exemple dans l&rsquo;écran <em>Widgets</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour en savoir plus, vous pouvez consulter cet article (en anglais) : </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Z65XzE2Jdn"><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/09/the-block-editor-javascript-module-in-5-2/">The Block Editor JavaScript module in 5.2</a></blockquote><iframe title="&#8220;The Block Editor JavaScript module in 5.2&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" src="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/09/the-block-editor-javascript-module-in-5-2/embed/#?secret=Z65XzE2Jdn" data-secret="Z65XzE2Jdn" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Accessibilité</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Une amélioration du balisage des onglets utilisés dans l&rsquo;administration WordPress a été intégrée, ainsi que du balisage des formats d’articles, de la barre d’administration, et le Widget de sélection d&rsquo;archives d&rsquo;articles a maintenant un meilleur fonctionnement sur les technologies d&rsquo;assistance telles que les lecteurs d&rsquo;écrans/synthèses vocales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour en savoir plus sur ces changements (en anglais) : </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NhV3S5uMlh"><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/02/admin-tabs-semantic-improvements-in-5-2/">Admin Tabs Semantic Improvements in 5.2</a></blockquote><iframe title="&#8220;Admin Tabs Semantic Improvements in 5.2&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" src="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/02/admin-tabs-semantic-improvements-in-5-2/embed/#?secret=NhV3S5uMlh" data-secret="NhV3S5uMlh" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="M74Sdl656H"><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/notable-accessibility-changes-in-5-2/">Notable Accessibility Changes in 5.2</a></blockquote><iframe title="&#8220;Notable Accessibility Changes in 5.2&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" src="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/notable-accessibility-changes-in-5-2/embed/#?secret=M74Sdl656H" data-secret="M74Sdl656H" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confidentialité</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Le composant <em>Privacy</em> (confidentialité) du cœur WordPress a été amélioré avec l&rsquo;ajout de 4 nouvelles fonctionnalités pour rendre la personnalisation et le design de la page de politique de confidentialité plus simple.

Nous esp&eacute;rons que vous trouverez quelque chose qui s&rsquo;applique &agrave; votre entreprise.</p>\n<aside id="sidebar-cta-mini"><div id="sidebar-cta-mini-aligner">\n    <div class="cta-mini cta-mini--floating">\n      <div class="cta-mini--light">\n        <div class="heading--normal mb--30 text--superbold">Obtenez jusqu''&agrave; 200% de boost de vitesse de votre site WordPress juste en d&eacute;m&eacute;nageant chez Kinsta.</div>\n        <div class="mt--10">\n          <a class="button--purple button--small" href="https://kinsta.com/fr/plans/?article-sidebar-floating">Migrer aujourd''hui gratuitement</a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside><p>Pour &ecirc;tre clair, ne vous attendez pas &agrave; des hacks de croissance secrets que personne n&rsquo;a jamais utilis&eacute;s auparavant ou &agrave; des balles d&rsquo;argent qui vous permettront d&rsquo;obtenir instantan&eacute;ment de grandes mentions dans les m&eacute;dias et des milliers d&rsquo;inscriptions. <strong>Nous ne sommes</strong> ni plus intelligents ni plus habiles que vous. Votre succ&egrave;s d&eacute;pend vraiment de vous et de combien vous voulez r&eacute;ussir.</p>\n<p>R&eacute;aliser des millions de revenus r&eacute;currents annuels (RRA) &agrave; partir de z&eacute;ro est une bonne chose. En fait, &ccedil;a fait du bien. &#128521; Mais une fois que vous y arriverez, vous passerez rapidement &agrave; autre chose et commencerez &agrave; penser &agrave; vos prochaines &eacute;tapes, &agrave; votre prochain produit, service, module ou canal de marketing qui vous apportera une foule de nouveaux prospects et clients. Votre <strong>prochain objectif devient soudainement le chiffre d&rsquo;affaires &agrave; 9 chiffres</strong> et comment l&rsquo;atteindre.</p>\n<p>Mais il est important de noter que la <strong>gestion d&rsquo;une entreprise n&rsquo;est pas seulement une question d&rsquo;argent</strong> ou de chiffre d&rsquo;affaires. Il s&rsquo;agit de b&acirc;tir une &eacute;quipe, de r&eacute;soudre des probl&egrave;mes jour apr&egrave;s jour, de stimuler l&rsquo;innovation, d&rsquo;embaucher et de licencier, de faire preuve de responsabilit&eacute;, d&rsquo;auto-apprentissage, d&rsquo;autogestion et bien plus encore. C&rsquo;est quelque chose qui ne peut &ecirc;tre appris &agrave; l&rsquo;&eacute;cole ou enseign&eacute; par quiconque. Vous devez le faire, pratiquer, r&eacute;soudre des probl&egrave;mes, faire des erreurs, apprendre d&rsquo;eux et vous am&eacute;liorer.</p>\n<p>J&rsquo;esp&egrave;re que cet article vous &eacute;clairera sur l&rsquo;auto-financement et vous inspirera &agrave; vous lancer en affaires.</p>\n<h2>D&rsquo;accord, on Commence ?</h2>\n<p>Tout d&rsquo;abord, commen&ccedil;ons par un peu d&rsquo;arri&egrave;re-plan qui pourrait ajouter du contexte &agrave; cette histoire.</p>\n<p>Kinsta a &eacute;t&eacute; fond&eacute;e par quatre d&rsquo;entre nous : Mark, Anita, Peter et moi-m&ecirc;me. En 2013, nous avons fourni des services de d&eacute;veloppement web et de marketing en ligne aux petites et moyennes entreprises. C&rsquo;&eacute;tait bien, mais ce n&rsquo;&eacute;tait pas amusant et, surtout, nous avons d&eacute;couvert que le business model n&rsquo;&eacute;tait pas &eacute;volutif. Nous devions trouver de nouveaux clients chaque mois pour maintenir les revenus, mais en raison des ressources limit&eacute;es, nous ne pouvions pas d&eacute;marrer plus de projets n&eacute;cessaires &agrave; notre croissance. Nous savions que nous devions changer cela.</p>\n<p>&Agrave; l&rsquo;&eacute;poque, nous travaillions exclusivement avec le syst&egrave;me de gestion de contenu <a href="https://kinsta.com/fr/blog/pourquoi-utiliser-wordpress/">WordPress</a>. Pourquoi ? Parce qu&rsquo;il est gratuit, poss&egrave;de des dizaines de milliers d&rsquo;extensions (<a href="https://kinsta.com/best-wordpress-plugins/">extensions et th&egrave;mes</a>), et vous pouvez construire relativement rapidement n&rsquo;importe quel type de site web en l&rsquo;utilisant. Cependant, apr&egrave;s la fin d&rsquo;un projet, le client nous posait habituellement les questions suivantes :</p>\n<blockquote><p>Pouvez-vous assurer l&rsquo;h&eacute;bergement de mon site web ? Je ne suis pas un administrateur syst&egrave;me et je ne veux pas m&rsquo;en occuper.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Et nous avons r&eacute;pondu non, nous ne fournissons pas d&rsquo;h&eacute;bergement web. 20 cas similaires plus tard, nous avons clairement vu qu&rsquo;il s&rsquo;agissait d&rsquo;une opportunit&eacute; commerciale et apr&egrave;s plusieurs discussions entre nous, nous avons finalement d&eacute;cid&eacute; de l&rsquo;essayer.</p>\n<p>Maintenant, 4 ans plus tard, <a href="https://kinsta.com/">Kinsta</a> fournit l&rsquo;h&eacute;bergement web pour des milliers de sites WordPress. Notre client&egrave;le s&rsquo;&eacute;tend des petites entreprises et blogs jusqu&rsquo;aux grandes entreprises entre 500 et 5000 emplloy&eacute;s. C&rsquo;est une <a href="https://kinsta.com/fr/blog/hebergement-wordpress-infogere/">solution g&eacute;r&eacute;e</a>, ce qui signifie que nous nous occupons de l&rsquo;infrastructure, des mises &agrave; jour des serveurs, de la protection de votre site, de l&rsquo;analyse, nous nous assurons qu&rsquo;ils se chargent rapidement et qu&rsquo;ils fournissent un support 24/7.</p>\n<p>Ce que je peux vous dire, c&rsquo;est que nous n&rsquo;avons jamais imagin&eacute; &agrave; quel point ce serait difficile, combien de probl&egrave;mes nous aurions &agrave; affronter chaque semaine ou chaque mois, et combien de sacrifices seraient n&eacute;cessaires pour que cela fonctionne. Nous sommes une entreprise<strong> 100% auto-financ&eacute;e</strong>. Quand nous avons d&eacute;cid&eacute; d&rsquo;essayer Kinsta en 2013, nous n&rsquo;avions pas d&rsquo;argent &agrave; la banque, juste ce que nous avions dans nos poches.</p>\n<p>Auparavant, nous avons d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;crit sur <a href="https://kinsta.com/fr/blog/chemin-capital-risque/">les avantages du bootstrapping et de ne pas passer par la voie de la lev&eacute;e de fonds</a>. Depuis la fondation de Kinsta, de nombreuses soci&eacute;t&eacute;s de capital-risque ont cherch&eacute; &agrave; &eacute;tablir un partenariat potentiel (et continuent de le faire). Mais pendant lles premi&egrave;res ann&eacute;es, <strong>nous voulions d&eacute;tenir 100% de notre entreprise</strong> et nous &eacute;tions tout &agrave; fait d&rsquo;accord avec une croissance plus lente et mieux contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e. Nous ne sommes pas du tout contre les lev&eacute;es de fonds ! Elles sont formidables et n&eacute;cessaires dans bien des cas. De nombreuses entreprises du secteur des technollogies (et bien d&rsquo;autres) n&rsquo;existeraient m&ecirc;me pas sans elles.</p>\n<p>Mais lorsqu&rsquo;il s&rsquo;agit de recueillir des fonds, vous devez <strong>peser le pour et le contre</strong> et prioriser les choses qui sont importantes pour vous. Nous sommes rest&eacute;s fid&egrave;les &agrave; notre id&eacute;e originale et nous sommes donc une entreprise autofinanc&eacute;e (j&rsquo;aime bien le terme &laquo;&nbsp;<em>financ&eacute;e par le client&nbsp;&raquo;</em>) et en pleine expansion.</p>\n<p>Saviez-vous que <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/09/25/why-startups-fail-according-to-their-founders/">neuf startups sur dix</a> &eacute;chouent ? C&rsquo;est la tendance et peut-&ecirc;tre la nature de l&rsquo;entreprise. Si vous &ecirc;tes un auto-financeur, plusieurs des le&ccedil;ons ci-dessous vous sembleront famili&egrave;res (bonjour les &acirc;mes s&oelig;urs). Si vous pr&eacute;voyez simplement lancer votre nouveau projet, continuez &agrave; lire et apprenez comment aider votre entreprise &agrave; survivre et &agrave; cro&icirc;tre. Voici les le&ccedil;ons les plus importantes que nous avons apprises en faisant d&eacute;marrer Kinsta d&rsquo;une start-up &agrave; une entreprise.</p>\n<h2>1. Construire une Marque d&egrave;s le Premier Jour</h2>\n<p>Je suis s&ucirc;r que vous avez entendu parler du terme strat&eacute;gie des oc&eacute;ans bleu et rouge ou des compagnies oc&eacute;aniques bleu et rouge. Les oc&eacute;ans rouges sont les industries qui existent aujourd&rsquo;hui o&ugrave; les entreprises tentent de sur-performer les unes sur les autres et de s&rsquo;accaparer une plus grande part du march&eacute; existant. La concurrence acharn&eacute;e rend cet oc&eacute;an rouge sanglant &ndash; semblable &agrave; un beau terrain de jeu pour les requins. Mais vous savez quoi ? Un march&eacute; surcharg&eacute; avec beaucoup de concurrents signifie que les gens ont besoin de ce service ou de ce produit et qu&rsquo;ils sont pr&ecirc;ts &agrave; payer de l&rsquo;argent pour cela.</p>\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width: 1398px"><img src="https://kinsta.com/fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/11/strategie-ocean-rouge-contre-strategie-ocean-bleu.jpg" alt="Strat&eacute;gie de l''oc&eacute;an rouge contre strat&eacute;gie de l''oc&eacute;an bleu" width="1398" height="787"><p class="wp-caption-text">Strat&eacute;gie de l&rsquo;oc&eacute;an rouge contre strat&eacute;gie de l&rsquo;oc&eacute;an bleu</p></div>\n<p>Ensuite, il y a les entreprises d&rsquo;oc&eacute;an bleu, qui op&egrave;rent dans un espace de march&eacute; inexploit&eacute; et cr&eacute;ent de la demande tout en ayant la possibilit&eacute; d&rsquo;une croissance rapide. La concurrence est faible ou inexistante.</p>\n<p>Si votre nouvelle entreprise est une entreprise d&rsquo;oc&eacute;an bleu, c&rsquo;est formidable ; vous pouvez &ecirc;tre un chef de file de l&rsquo;industrie et dominer votre niche. Cependant, le bleu oc&eacute;an signifie souvent que le bassin de clients est faible et parfois c&rsquo;est un domaine compl&egrave;tement nouveau. Il se peut m&ecirc;me qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y ait pas encore besoin de votre service ou de votre produit.</p>\n<p>Les chances sont beaucoup plus &eacute;lev&eacute;es que vous vous retrouviez dans un environnement oc&eacute;anique rouge parmi les entreprises &eacute;tablies avec des ann&eacute;es d&rsquo;avantage de leur c&ocirc;t&eacute;. Ils ont des revenus, une vaste client&egrave;le, une pr&eacute;sence &eacute;tablie dans les r&eacute;seaux sociaux et d&rsquo;importants budgets de marketing. Alors, comment pouvez-vous leur faire concurrence &agrave; long terme ? La seule fa&ccedil;on d&rsquo;y parvenir, c&rsquo;est d&rsquo;avoir une marque et de la construire consciemment depuis le d&eacute;but. Une marque que votre base d&rsquo;utilisateurs potentiels peut reconna&icirc;tre et m&eacute;moriser.</p>\n<p><strong>Vous ne pouvez vous diff&eacute;rencier de vos concurrents que si vous avez une marque</strong>. Je vois tant d&rsquo;entreprises qui utilisent des noms sans marque (conditions g&eacute;n&eacute;rales/localisation+mots-cl&eacute;s), tels que michigandesigner.com, denverdesignagency.com ou bestwphosting.com.</p>\n<p>M&ecirc;me si ces compagnies g&eacute;n&eacute;riques offrent un excellent service, je ne d&eacute;penserais probablement pas d&rsquo;argent avec eux, car il y a un manque de confiance. Si vous faites des affaires, faites-le en tant que marque et d&eacute;marquez-vous de la foule en ayant votre propre nom de marque.</p>\n<p>Je me souviens que nous avons pass&eacute; plusieurs semaines &agrave; trouver le nom final &laquo;&nbsp;Kinsta&nbsp;&raquo;. Nous n&rsquo;&eacute;tions pas assis 24/7, &agrave; nous regarder dans les yeux, mais &agrave; y penser tout en travaillant sur d&rsquo;autres t&acirc;ches. Vous avez besoin de trouver quelque chose d&rsquo;unique, court et personnalisable.</p>\n<h2>2. Obtenir vos 100 Premiers Clients Est le Voyage le Plus Difficile de Votre Vie</h2>\n<p>Votre site web est pr&ecirc;t (en fait, il n&rsquo;est jamais pr&ecirc;t, mais assez bon pour commencer) et vous attendez que vos premiers clients viennent payer pour votre service. La triste r&eacute;alit&eacute;, c&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;ils ne viendront pas si vous ne vous assurez pas qu&rsquo;ils vous connaissent. Votre entreprise est toute neuve, vous n&rsquo;avez pas de clients, de t&eacute;moignages ou d&rsquo;histoire d&rsquo;entreprise, alors pourquoi vous feraient-ils confiance ? Je suis s&ucirc;r que vous avez entendu parler de Moz, ils ont des outils SEO cool. Leur fondateur et magicien du marketing de contenu, Rand Fishkin, a d&eacute;clar&eacute; ce qui suit dans l&rsquo;une de ses <a href="https://moz.com/blog/the-greatest-misconception-in-content-marketing-whiteboard-friday">pr&eacute;sentations du Whiteboard Friday</a> :</p>\n<div id="attachment_34424" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width: 768px"><img class="size-full wp-image-34424" src="https://kinsta.com/fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/11/moz-whiteboard-friday.png" alt="Moz Whiteboard Friday" width="768" height="344"><p class="wp-caption-text">Moz Whiteboard Friday</p></div>\n<p><strong>Il leur faut 7,5 visites pour convertir quelqu&rsquo;un en essai gratuit. </strong>Pas en un client payant, il suffit de les inscrire pour un essai gratuit. Et Moz a une marque follement forte et est un acteur bien connu dans le domaine du <a href="https://kinsta.com/fr/blog/que-veut-dire-referencement-seo/">SEO</a>.</p>\n<p>Nous avons &eacute;t&eacute; confront&eacute;s exactement &agrave; la m&ecirc;me situation au cours de nos premiers mois &agrave; la fin de 2013 et au d&eacute;but de 2014. Des prospects venaient chaque jour pour demander ce qui suit :</p>\n<blockquote><p>Pouvez-vous me montrer certains de vos clients actuels, ou des clients de l&rsquo;industrie XYZ ?</p></blockquote>\n<p>C&rsquo;&eacute;tait difficile et frustrant. M&ecirc;me si vous &ecirc;tes un gars tr&egrave;s bien connect&eacute; avec des centaines d&rsquo;amis et de contacts professionnels, il est difficile d&rsquo;obtenir vos premiers clients payants. C&rsquo;est vraiment dur. Voici certaines choses que nous avons faites pour obtenir nos premiers clients :</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Donnez beaucoup de valeur, comme du contenu gratuit et montrez que vous &ecirc;tes un expert</strong> &ndash; D&eacute;marrez votre section blog et fournissez du contenu de qualit&eacute;. Bloguez souvent et assurez-vous que ce que vous &eacute;crivez est de premi&egrave;re qualit&eacute; et utile pour votre public cible. <a href="https://kinsta.com/learn/content-marketing/">Le marketing de contenu fonctionne vraiment et convertit</a> quand il est bien fait. Pour en savoir plus &agrave; ce sujet, consultez la section sur le marketing de contenu ci-dessous.</li>\n<li><strong>Donnez quelques comptes gratuits</strong> &ndash; Nous l&rsquo;avons fait et &ccedil;a a plut&ocirc;t bien march&eacute;. Nous avons pu nous associer avec de grands &eacute;diteurs et, en &eacute;change d&rsquo;un h&eacute;bergement gratuit, les pr&eacute;senter sur notre site web. ainsi que leurs t&eacute;moignages impressionnants De plus, en tant que premiers utilisateurs, ils nous ont fourni des commentaires inestimables sur nos produits !</li>\n<li><strong>L&rsquo;e-mail est gratuit, n&rsquo;ayez pas peur de l&rsquo;utiliser</strong> &ndash; Au d&eacute;but, j&rsquo;&eacute;tais responsable de nos efforts de marketing. J&rsquo;ai &eacute;tabli beaucoup de relations avec d&rsquo;autres propri&eacute;taires d&rsquo;entreprises et blogueurs WordPress simplement en leur envoyant un e-mail froid pour entamer une conversation. J&rsquo;ai eu des contacts avec beaucoup de gens et je le fais encore aujourd&rsquo;hui. Je me souviens que nous avons eu beaucoup de nos premiers clients de cette fa&ccedil;on. Par exemple, j&rsquo;ai tendu la main &agrave; <a href="https://www.matthewbarby.com/">Matthew Barby</a>, un expert en r&eacute;f&eacute;rencement tr&egrave;s connu. Il est maintenant &agrave; la t&ecirc;te de la croissance chez Hubspot.com. J&rsquo;ai trouv&eacute; une de ses &eacute;tudes de cas extr&ecirc;mement utile et je lui ai tendu la main pour le remercier de son travail. Il s&rsquo;est av&eacute;r&eacute; qu&rsquo;il &eacute;tait &agrave; la recherche d&rsquo;un nouveau fournisseur d&rsquo;h&eacute;bergement car il &eacute;tait devenu trop grand pour son environnement actuel.</li>\n</ul><p>Et plus de 3 ans plus tard, il est toujours notre client d&rsquo;honneur. Vous voyez ? Tout a commenc&eacute; par un simple email.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I actually use Kinsta for all my hosting (no affiliation to them at all) and couldn''t recommend their tech and team more.

D&egrave;s que vous avez votre tout premier client payant, il devient plus facile d&rsquo;en avoir de nouveaux &agrave; bord. Mais obtenir vos 10 premiers clients prend le m&ecirc;me temps qu&rsquo;obtenir vos 100 premiers !</p>\n<h2>3. Trouvez les Meilleurs Talents dans le Monde (et M&ecirc;me &Eacute;conomisez de l&rsquo;Argent)</h2>\n<p>Nous avons une &eacute;quipe distribu&eacute;e de gens g&eacute;niaux dans le monde entier. Nous avons des membres de l&rsquo;&eacute;quipe aux &Eacute;tats-Unis, en Europe, en Australie, en Inde, en Indon&eacute;sie, au Nicaragua, etc. Voici quelques raisons pour lesquelles nous avons choisi une &eacute;quipe distribu&eacute;e pour Kinsta.</p>\n<p>En raison de la nature de notre service, nous devons <strong>fournir un support 24/7 365 jours par an</strong>. Et ce n&rsquo;est pas tout, nous devons &ecirc;tre tr&egrave;s r&eacute;actifs ! Nous avons des clients du monde entier, ce qui signifie que nous devons couvrir tous les fuseaux horaires. Si vous ne travaillez qu&rsquo;avec une &eacute;quipe locale et que vous avez besoin d&rsquo;une couverture mondiale 24h/7j, cela pourrait &ecirc;tre difficile &agrave; g&eacute;rer. Toutefois, si vous n&rsquo;avez pas besoin de fournir ce niveau de support, la recherche de vos prochains employ&eacute;s &agrave; l&rsquo;&eacute;chelle mondiale peut quand m&ecirc;me &ecirc;tre une bonne id&eacute;e.</p>\n<p>Supposons que vous &ecirc;tes &agrave; la recherche d&rsquo;un d&eacute;veloppeur, de DevOps, d&rsquo;un sp&eacute;cialiste du marketing de contenu ou d&rsquo;un agent commercial. La r&eacute;alit&eacute; est que vous ne trouverez probablement pas les personnes les plus talentueuses dans votre ville natale ou m&ecirc;me dans votre propre pays. Et m&ecirc;me si vous en avez trouv&eacute; un ou deux, il n&rsquo;y en a probablement pas beaucoup. Ce tweet ci-dessous r&eacute;sume bien les avantages d&rsquo;avoir une &eacute;quipe partiellement distante.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why we&rsquo;re 100% remote:<br>1.

Les <strong>personnes talentueuses peuvent g&eacute;rer leur temps</strong> et &ecirc;tre tr&egrave;s productives en travaillant &agrave; partir d&rsquo;un bureau &agrave; domicile. Vous pouvez aussi &eacute;conomiser beaucoup d&rsquo;argent en ne louant pas un &eacute;norme bureau en centre-ville.</p>\n<p>Et ai-je mentionn&eacute; les &eacute;conomies sur les salaires ? Un bon d&eacute;veloppeur back-end de la c&ocirc;te Ouest des &Eacute;tats-Unis vous co&ucirc;terait au moins 2x plus cher qu&rsquo;un d&eacute;veloppeur d&rsquo;Europe Centrale. Les salaires repr&eacute;sentent la plus grande partie des d&eacute;penses d&rsquo;entreprise. Si vous additionnez ces montants, vous r&eacute;aliserez rapidement combien d&rsquo;argent vous pouvez &eacute;conomiser sur une base annuelle et investir cet argent dans l&rsquo;embauche d&rsquo;autres personnes, ou d&eacute;penser plus pour de marketing et de d&eacute;veloppement de produits. L&rsquo;embauche de travailleurs &agrave; distance peut avoir d&rsquo;<strong>&eacute;normes r&eacute;percussions financi&egrave;res</strong>.</p>\n<p>Un autre conseil est que vous devriez <strong>embaucher des gens plus intelligents que vous</strong> si vous voulez r&eacute;ussir. Vous pouvez &ecirc;tre bon dans le codage, les ventes et l&rsquo;embauche, mais vous ne serez jamais excellent. Ne soyez pas un maniaque du contr&ocirc;le, laissez quelqu&rsquo;un qui peut le faire mieux que vous le faire passer au niveau sup&eacute;rieur.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Construisez un MVP, Lancez et Commercialisez T&ocirc;t</h2>\n<p>MVP (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">Minimum viable product</a>) est un terme commun lorsqu&rsquo;il s&rsquo;agit de lancer votre produit. Il s&rsquo;agit essentiellement d&rsquo;un produit avec<strong> juste assez de fonctionnalit&eacute;s</strong> pour satisfaire les premiers clients. Si vous &ecirc;tes perfectionniste, vous d&eacute;testez probablement cette id&eacute;e, mais passons &agrave; autre chose et familiarisons-nous avec elle. Sinon, vous ne vous lancerez jamais, et vous continuerez d&rsquo;avoir plus de retards et d&rsquo;autres &eacute;ch&eacute;ances. Vous passerez &eacute;galement &agrave; c&ocirc;t&eacute; d&rsquo;un avis inestimable de la part des clients, de la capacit&eacute; d&rsquo;&eacute;valuer le march&eacute;, des produits d&rsquo;exploitation et des premiers clients.</p>\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width: 996px"><img src="https://kinsta.com/fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/11/minimum-viable-produit.png" alt="Minimum de produit viable par rapport au produit" width="996" height="404"><p class="wp-caption-text">Minimum de produit viable par rapport au produit</p></div>\n<p>Nous &eacute;tions confront&eacute;s au m&ecirc;me probl&egrave;me et, tout d&rsquo;abord, il &eacute;tait difficile d&rsquo;accepter que notre produit ne soit jamais parfait ou compl&egrave;tement pr&ecirc;t. Ou que nous ne serions pas en mesure de fournir toutes les fonctionnalit&eacute;s que nous voulions dans les 6 premiers mois.</p>\n<p>Nous avons donc construit un MVP, qui manquait de nombreuses fonctionnalit&eacute;s par rapport &agrave; nos concurrents, mais qui &eacute;tait assez bon pour d&eacute;marrer et commercialiser. Nous n&rsquo;avions pas de <a href="https://kinsta.com/fr/base-de-connaissances/environnement-de-developpement/">zone de test</a>, de SSL automatis&eacute;, de <a href="https://kinsta.com/fr/base-de-connaissances/emplacements-centres-de-donnees-google-cloud/">localisations mondiales des centres de donn&eacute;es</a>, d&rsquo;int&eacute;gration DNS haut de gamme ou d&rsquo;analyse d&eacute;taill&eacute;e dans le tableau de bord de l&rsquo;administrateur. Mais pas &agrave; pas, nous avons ajout&eacute; tous ces &eacute;l&eacute;ments. Et pendant que nous travaillions sur ces nouvelles fonctions indispensables, de nouveaux clients s&rsquo;inscrivaient au service chaque jour. Nous sommes tr&egrave;s heureux d&rsquo;avoir d&eacute;cid&eacute; d&rsquo;aller dans cette direction et d&rsquo;avoir pris le d&eacute;part plus t&ocirc;t. Si nous devions recommencer, nous l&rsquo;aborderions de la m&ecirc;me fa&ccedil;on.</p>\n<p>Mon conseil est de <strong>commencer la commercialisation t&ocirc;t</strong>. Testez le march&eacute;. Obtenez un retour pr&eacute;coce et tirez-en des le&ccedil;ons. S&rsquo;adapter, changer et apporter des am&eacute;liorations. Comme Steve Blank <a href="https://hackernoon.com/an-mvp-is-not-a-cheaper-product-it-s-about-smart-learning-77eed770f60c">le dit</a>, le MVP n&rsquo;est pas un produit moins cher, il s&rsquo;agit d&rsquo;un apprentissage intelligent. Aussi, ce conseil de <a href="https://producthabits.com/why-trello-failed-to-build-a-1-billion-business/">Hiten Shah</a> ci-dessous est parfait. Dans le SaaS, vous gagnez continuellement en <strong>r&eacute;solvant mieux le</strong> <strong>probl&egrave;me</strong>.</p>\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width: 1024px"><img src="https://kinsta.com/fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/11/citation-saas.jpeg" alt="Citation SaaS de Hiten Shah" width="1024" height="512"><p class="wp-caption-text">Citation SaaS de Hiten Shah</p></div>\n<p>Souvenez-vous, vous &ecirc;tes dans un jeu &agrave; long terme.

Suivez le Principe du &laquo;&nbsp;Hire Slow Fire Fast&nbsp;&raquo;</h2>\n<p>Ceci semble &eacute;vident, mais peu de gens le suivent. <strong>Vos employ&eacute;s sont le c&oelig;ur de votre entreprise</strong>.

Nous n&rsquo;avons pas suivi le processus d&rsquo;embauche mentionn&eacute; ci-dessus.

Quand je dis &laquo;&nbsp;d&egrave;s que possible&nbsp;&raquo;, je veux dire quelques jours apr&egrave;s que vous ayez r&eacute;alis&eacute; que &ccedil;a ne marcherait pas. Tout d&rsquo;abord, vous n&rsquo;avez pas beaucoup d&rsquo;argent et vous ne voulez pas le d&eacute;penser pour un employ&eacute; qui n&rsquo;a pas sa place dans votre &eacute;quipe. Deuxi&egrave;mement, il n&rsquo;est pas logique de parler encore et encore des choses, d&rsquo;essayer de changer leur attitude ou leur personnalit&eacute;. D&icirc;tes au revoir et passe &agrave; autre chose.</p>\n<h2>6. Connaissez vos Chiffres et Concentrez-Vous sur la Rentabilit&eacute;</h2>\n<p>Cette &eacute;tape est vraiment cruciale. Si vous &ecirc;tes autofinanc&eacute;, vous devez toujours conna&icirc;tre vos param&egrave;tres financiers les plus importants. Vous ne pouvez d&eacute;penser que l&rsquo;argent que vous avez gagn&eacute; le mois dernier, car vous n&rsquo;avez pas d&rsquo;argent ext&eacute;rieur dans lequel investir. Vous <strong>apprendrez</strong> rapidement l&rsquo;<strong>importance de l&rsquo;argent comptant</strong>. D&eacute;penser de l&rsquo;argent qui d&eacute;pend des revenus que vous g&eacute;n&eacute;rez est tr&egrave;s diff&eacute;rent de d&eacute;penser l&rsquo;argent de quelqu&rsquo;un d&rsquo;autre (comme les dollars de capital-risque).</p>\n<p>Ou pensez-y comme &ccedil;a : &laquo;&nbsp;<em>Enfant, vous avez d&eacute;pens&eacute; vos revenus d&rsquo;emploi d&rsquo;&eacute;t&eacute; plus judicieusement que l&rsquo;argent &laquo;&nbsp;facile&nbsp;&raquo; que votre grand-m&egrave;re vous a donn&eacute;, n&rsquo;est-ce pas ?&nbsp;&raquo;</em></p>\n<p>En tant qu&rsquo;auto-financeur, vous devez g&eacute;n&eacute;rer des revenus, sinon, <strong>vous ne survivrez pas</strong>. Vous &ecirc;tes naturellement plus prudent. Si vous continuez &agrave; fonctionner &agrave; partir de vos revenus durement gagn&eacute;s, dans ce cas-ci, cela signifie aussi que vous &ecirc;tes rentable. Et maintenant que vous avez du profit, vous pouvez commencer &agrave; r&eacute;fl&eacute;chir &agrave; la fa&ccedil;on de le distribuer.</p>\n<p>Dans notre cas, nous r&eacute;investissons autant que possible. Nous continuons d&rsquo;embaucher de nouveaux membres de l&rsquo;&eacute;quipe tout le temps et nous consacrons de plus en plus de temps &agrave; la cr&eacute;ation de contenu, &agrave; la promotion et &agrave; l&rsquo;acquisition de clients r&eacute;mun&eacute;r&eacute;s. La bonne nouvelle, c&rsquo;est que ce que vous faites avec l&rsquo;argent suppl&eacute;mentaire d&eacute;pend de vous.</p>\n<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width: 1244px"><img src="https://kinsta.com/fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/11/revenu-mensuel-recurrent-kinsta.png" alt="Revenu mensuel r&eacute;current Kinsta" width="1244" height="317"><p class="wp-caption-text">Revenu mensuel r&eacute;current Kinsta</p></div>\n<p>Au fur et &agrave; mesure que <a href="https://kinsta.com/fr/blog/modele-revenus-recurrents/">le revenu mensuel r&eacute;current</a> (MRR) augmente, nous pouvons r&eacute;investir de plus en plus.

Parfois, il faut des semaines, des mois ou un an et demi pour le faire r&eacute;parer, mais vous trouverez une solution. Apr&egrave;s avoir consacr&eacute; d&rsquo;innombrables heures de travail acharn&eacute; &agrave; votre entreprise, l&rsquo;&eacute;chec n&rsquo;est pas une option.</p>\n<p>Combien de fois avons-nous &eacute;t&eacute; confront&eacute;s &agrave; une situation difficile ? Beaucoup, beaucoup de fois. Et vous vous retrouverez dans la m&ecirc;me situation, peu importe ce que vous en pensez.</p>\n<p>Pour ne citer qu&rsquo;un exemple. Nous &eacute;tions d&eacute;j&agrave; en activit&eacute; lorsqu&rsquo;un jour, sans pr&eacute;avis, notre compte Stripe a &eacute;t&eacute; suspendu en raison d&rsquo;une activit&eacute; frauduleuse qui &eacute;tait hors de notre contr&ocirc;le. Le support de Stripe a r&eacute;pondu &agrave; notre cas par une r&eacute;ponse &eacute;crite disant que notre compte &eacute;tait ferm&eacute; d&eacute;finitivement et qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y avait aucun moyen de le r&eacute;activer. Tu te fous de moi, c&rsquo;est &ccedil;a ?</p>\n<p>Nous n&rsquo;avons pas &eacute;t&eacute; en mesure de facturer les cartes bancaires ou de percevoir nos recettes. Nous avons rapidement commenc&eacute; &agrave; chercher une solution, cependant, l&rsquo;int&eacute;gration d&rsquo;un nouveau processeur de paiement dans votre syst&egrave;me existant n&rsquo;est pas un travail de 5 minutes. Malgr&eacute; cela, nous avons commenc&eacute; &agrave; travailler dessus et, entre-temps, nous avons &eacute;labor&eacute; cet <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/startups-avoid-stripe/">barticle de blog racontant notre histoire</a> &agrave; la communaut&eacute; des jeunes entreprises. La tendance s&rsquo;est rapidement orient&eacute;e vers HN et Reddit. Stripe nous a ensuite tendu la main pour <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/how-we-got-our-stripe-account-back/">r&eacute;soudre l&rsquo;affaire</a>, parce que personne n&rsquo;aime la mauvaise presse. Voyez-vous, d&rsquo;abord, il semblait qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y avait aucun moyen de le r&eacute;soudre et en 48 heures, nous &eacute;tions de retour en affaires.</p>\n<h2>8. Ce N&rsquo;est Pas un Travail de 9 &agrave; 5. Pr&eacute;parez-vous &agrave; Travailler des Heures Folles</h2>\n<p>Ne vous m&eacute;prenez pas, le succ&egrave;s n&rsquo;est pas facile. Vous devrez travailler pour obtenir des r&eacute;sultats. Cela signifie souvent &ecirc;tre assis 16 heures par jour devant votre ordinateur, r&eacute;pondre aux demandes de support, parler aux clients potentiels et conclure des affaires. Au d&eacute;but, il est pr&eacute;f&eacute;rable d&rsquo;oublier les week-ends ou les jours f&eacute;ri&eacute;s. Je me souviens qu&rsquo;en d&eacute;cembre 2015, l&rsquo;un de nos fournisseurs de serveurs a &eacute;t&eacute; victime d&rsquo;une attaque DDoS de grande envergure qui a entra&icirc;n&eacute; une panne de 2 &agrave; 3 jours pour l&rsquo;ensemble de nos centres de donn&eacute;es. Et c&rsquo;est arriv&eacute; pendant la ru&eacute;e de No&euml;l.</p>\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width: 775px"><img src="https://kinsta.com/fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/11/ddos.png" alt="DDoS" width="775" height="244"><p class="wp-caption-text">DDoS (Img src : <a href="https://status.linode.com/incidents/tm2b0tl5yc9g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linode status</a>)</p></div>\n<p>Meilleur No&euml;l de tous les temps&hellip;</p>\n<p>Nous &eacute;tions assis devant nos ordinateurs 24/7, &agrave; r&eacute;pondre aux clients et &agrave; d&eacute;placer des sites toute la journ&eacute;e d&rsquo;autres fournisseurs pour les remettre en ligne le plus rapidement possible. Vous pouvez imaginer que ce n&rsquo;&eacute;tait pas le cadeau de No&euml;l que nous esp&eacute;rions, mais nous ne l&rsquo;oublierons jamais, c&rsquo;est s&ucirc;r. Et surtout, nous avons appris une le&ccedil;on pr&eacute;cieuse, qui a confirm&eacute; notre d&eacute;cision que nous devions <a href="https://kinsta.com/fr/blog/hebergement-wordpress-infogere/-in-the-google-cloud/">d&eacute;placer notre service vers le cloud</a>.</p>\n<p>Pour les auto-financeurs, les premi&egrave;res ann&eacute;es sont difficiles. D&rsquo;innombrables entrepreneurs affirment qu&rsquo;il est possible de b&acirc;tir une entreprise &agrave; partir de rien en travaillant quelques heures par jour ou par semaine. Je ne les crois pas et vous ne devriez pas non plus, c&rsquo;est une illusion. Personnellement, nous savons &agrave; quel point il est difficile de b&acirc;tir son entreprise par ses propres moyens, et je suis certain que bon nombre d&rsquo;entre vous peuvent en t&eacute;moigner.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Work long hours" src="https://kinsta.com/fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/11/work-long-hours.gif" alt="work long hours" width="437" height="317"></p>\n<p>Lorsque je me rends au lit &agrave; minuit ou plus tard, j&rsquo;ai encore des e-mails auxquels j&rsquo;aurais d&ucirc; r&eacute;pondre, des onglets ouverts avec des nouvelles de l&rsquo;industrie, des articles et des tutoriels que je n&rsquo;ai pas eu le temps de lire ce jour-l&agrave;, et des cartes Trello auxquelles je pouvais contribuer. Et il y a toujours autre chose dont j&rsquo;aurais d&ucirc; m&rsquo;occuper.</p>\n<p>Cela ne veut pas dire que ma productivit&eacute; est faible ou que je n&rsquo;arrive pas &agrave; me d&eacute;brouiller seul, c&rsquo;est le r&eacute;sultat lorsque vous portez plusieurs casquettes en m&ecirc;me temps et que vous n&rsquo;avez pas assez de temps pour tout finir avant la fin de votre journ&eacute;e de travail. Mais c&rsquo;est tr&egrave;s bien et disons amusant, car cela vous met au d&eacute;fi tous les jours.</p>\n<p>Si vous n&rsquo;&ecirc;tes pas pr&ecirc;t &agrave; travailler des heures folles au d&eacute;but, peut-&ecirc;tre que vous ne devriez pas d&eacute;marrer une entreprise auto-financ&eacute;e. Si vous pr&eacute;f&eacute;rez une journ&eacute;e de 9h &agrave; 17h, c&rsquo;est tr&egrave;s bien, je comprends et je respecte cela. Cela a ses propres avantages. Mais quand il s&rsquo;agit d&rsquo;amorcer et de construire quelque chose &agrave; partir de z&eacute;ro, il faut faire un effort suppl&eacute;mentaire, travailler deux fois plus et deux fois plus dur que n&rsquo;importe qui d&rsquo;autre.</p>\n<h2>9. Consacrez Tout le Temps Dont Vous Disposez &agrave; Votre Entreprise</h2>\n<p>Mon conseil serait, si vous avez trouv&eacute; un bon march&eacute; et que vous croyez vraiment en votre id&eacute;e, <strong>consacrez toute votre attention et toutes vos ressources</strong> &agrave; celle-ci. Ne le traitez pas comme un projet secondaire ou un passe-temps de week-end. Que se passerait-il si vous &eacute;chouiez ? Rien, mais au moins vous ne regretterez pas &agrave; l&rsquo;avenir de ne pas l&rsquo;avoir essay&eacute; honn&ecirc;tement.</p>\n<p>En 2014, Nathan Barry, le fondateur de l&rsquo;entreprise <a href="https://convertkit.com/">ConvertKit</a> aussi <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/5k/">a d&ucirc; prendre cette d&eacute;cision</a>. ConvertKit est une solution de marketing par e-mail pour les blogueurs. Nathan a eu quelques succ&egrave;s pr&eacute;coces, il avait des clients payants et quelques MRR pr&eacute;coces, mais ConvertKit n&rsquo;a pas donn&eacute; les r&eacute;sultats qu&rsquo;il esp&eacute;rait. Il l&rsquo;a trait&eacute; comme un projet parall&egrave;le, ce qui n&rsquo;&eacute;tait plus une option. C&rsquo;&eacute;tait l&rsquo;heure de la d&eacute;cision. Il avait deux choix : l&rsquo;arr&ecirc;ter ou se concentrer et travailler &agrave; 100%.</p>\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width: 656px"><img src="https://kinsta.com/fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/11/convertkit-temps-decision.png" alt="ConvertKit - temps de d&eacute;cision" width="656" height="322"><p class="wp-caption-text">ConvertKit &ndash; temps de d&eacute;cision</p></div>\n<p>Il a d&eacute;cid&eacute; d&rsquo;essayer et il a consacr&eacute; toute son attention &agrave; ConvertKit. Tous les autres projets sont devenus secondaires et il a commenc&eacute; &agrave; travailler &agrave; plein temps sur l&rsquo;entreprise. Que s&rsquo;est-il pass&eacute;, a-t-il r&eacute;ussi ? Eh bien, aujourd&rsquo;hui, ils grandissent &agrave; un tr&egrave;s bon rythme et ont une croissance &eacute;norme. <a href="https://convertkit.baremetrics.com/stats/mrr">800 000$ de MRR</a>. Pas mal.</p>\n<h2>10. Investir Massivement Dans le Marketing de Contenu et le SEO</h2>\n<p>Si vous &ecirc;tes une entreprise en d&eacute;marrage, vous n&rsquo;avez probablement pas de budget marketing du tout, &agrave; moins d&rsquo;appartenir &agrave; l&rsquo;un des plus chanceux (f&eacute;licitations d&rsquo;ailleurs !). Quoi qu&rsquo;il en soit, votre budget est probablement tr&egrave;s limit&eacute;.</p>\n<p>Lancer une campagne de PPC et cibler vos mots-cl&eacute;s ou les mots-cl&eacute;s de vos concurrents avec un budget mensuel de 10k n&rsquo;est pas une option. Il ne s&rsquo;agit pas non plus de d&eacute;penser des milliers de dollars en publicit&eacute;s sur Facebook ou d&rsquo;acheter quelques millions d&rsquo;affichages de banni&egrave;res sur des blogs &agrave; la pointe de l&rsquo;industrie. Mais cela ne veut pas dire que vous ne pouvez pas faire conna&icirc;tre vos produits, services et connaissances.</p>\n<p>Il y a ce qu&rsquo;on appelle le <strong>marketing de contenu</strong>. Je suis s&ucirc;r que vous l&rsquo;avez entendu au moins trois fois aujourd&rsquo;hui et probablement 95 fois cette semaine, mais la r&eacute;alit&eacute; est que ces choses fonctionnent vraiment et se convertissent quand elles sont faites comme elles devraient l&rsquo;&ecirc;tre.</p>\n<p>Depuis le premier jour, nous avons pris notre <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/">section de blog</a> tr&egrave;s au s&eacute;rieux, car nous n&rsquo;avions pas d&rsquo;autres options<a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/">.</a> Voici une capture d&rsquo;&eacute;cran de notre Google Analytics montrant comment le trafic a augment&eacute; au fil des ans. Comme vous pouvez le constater, il faut un certain temps pour construire votre &laquo;&nbsp;r&eacute;putation de contenu&nbsp;&raquo;. Et il faut encore plus de temps et d&rsquo;engagement pour b&acirc;tir un auditoire. Mais apr&egrave;s les 12 &agrave; 16 premiers mois, le trafic augmentera &agrave; un rythme plus rapide. Obtenir un bon trafic organique prend le plus de temps, mais c&rsquo;est celui qui rapporte le plus au fil du temps.</p>\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width: 1011px"><img src="https://kinsta.com/fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/11/croissance-organique-trafic.png" alt="Croissance organique du trafic" width="1011" height="171"><p class="wp-caption-text">Croissance organique du trafic</p></div>\n<p>Plus vite vous commencerez, plus vite vous verrez les r&eacute;sultats.

Ils sont tout simplement trop g&eacute;n&eacute;raux, courts et de qualit&eacute; m&eacute;diocre et n&rsquo;ont pas de valeur unique. Ces articles sont une perte de temps et de ressources.</p>\n<p>Alors, que devriez-vous faire ? Au lieu d&rsquo;&eacute;crire 5&times;500 mots par semaine, ce qui prend beaucoup de votre temps, faites des recherches sur le sujet et &eacute;crivez un guide de 5000 mots qui vaut la peine d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre partag&eacute; et qui offre une r&eacute;elle valeur &agrave; vos lecteurs. Ou publiez seulement 2 articles par mois, mais assurez-vous qu&rsquo;ils sont vraiment en profondeur et qu&rsquo;ils constituent la meilleure ressource dans votre secteur.

Et plus important encore, ce trafic convertit les lecteurs en clients, aussi bien que les bulletins d&rsquo;information <a href="https://kinsta.com/fr/blog/notifications-push-wordpress/">push de notifications</a>.</p>\n<p>Si vous n&rsquo;abandonnez pas vos efforts de marketing de contenu trop t&ocirc;t, votre aper&ccedil;u en direct de Google Analytics ressemblera &agrave; ceci pendant la majeure partie de la journ&eacute;e :</p>\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width: 1006px"><img src="https://kinsta.com/fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/11/google-analytics-visiteurs-temps-reel.png" alt="Google Analytics - visiteurs en temps r&eacute;el" width="1006" height="297"><p class="wp-caption-text">Google Analytics &ndash; visiteurs en temps r&eacute;el</p></div>\n<p>Le marketing de contenu est un jeu &agrave; long terme, mais il peut vous conduire &agrave; une quantit&eacute; folle de qualit&eacute;, de ciblage et de trafic gratuit qui se transforme en clients payants.</p>\n<p>Si vous avez de l&rsquo;argent, les publicit&eacute;s sont g&eacute;niales car elles peuvent vous g&eacute;n&eacute;rer un trafic cibl&eacute; instantan&eacute;, mais ce sont des clics uniques et vous devez garder votre portefeuille ouvert pour maintenir le niveau de trafic. Avoir un excellent blog ou une section de ressources qui est &agrave; jour et &agrave; laquelle vous ajoutez r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement du nouveau contenu peut avoir un impact &eacute;norme sur votre entreprise. Buffer, Copyblogger et Moz ont tous construit un empire bas&eacute; uniquement sur le contenu. Si vous souhaitez en savoir plus sur la fa&ccedil;on de commencer, jetez un coup d&rsquo;&oelig;il &agrave; l&rsquo;<a href="http://billwidmer.com/white-hat-seo-case-study/">&eacute;tude de cas Seo de Bill Widmer</a>.</p>      <div class="in-post-container">\n      <div id="simple-promo">\n  <div class="mb--20 mt--0 heading--normal">\n  Vous avez des probl&egrave;mes de temps d''indisponibilit&eacute; et de WordPress ?

Asseyez-vous, voil&agrave;. Concentrez-vous sur les Choses Importantes</h2>\n<p>La meilleure fa&ccedil;on de faire les choses est de simplement s&rsquo;asseoir et de commencer &agrave; travailler dessus. Il y aura toujours des excuses pour faire autre chose ou vous vous direz que vous commencerez &agrave; travailler dessus demain. Mais la v&eacute;rit&eacute; est que personne ne fera votre travail pour vous. Souvent, c&rsquo;est ennuyeux quand je dois passer des mois &agrave; comprendre notre nouveau mod&egrave;le de tarification, les co&ucirc;ts des serveurs, les marges b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires, mais c&rsquo;est mon travail de le faire d&egrave;s que je peux.</p>\n<p>Je vous conseille de vous <strong>concentrer sur les choses qui comptent vraiment ainsi que </strong>d&rsquo;appliquer la <a href="https://www.entrepreneurs-journey.com/397/80-20-rule-pareto-principle/">r&egrave;gle des 80/20</a>. Prenons un exemple, la conception de votre site web. Dans les premiers jours, ne perdez pas de temps &agrave; changer les couleurs du bouton Acheter maintenant de vert &agrave; vert p&acirc;le sur votre page de prix, en changeant votre image d&rsquo;arri&egrave;re-plan, ou en passant des heures &agrave; ajouter 3 ic&ocirc;nes suppl&eacute;mentaires &agrave; votre page d&rsquo;accueil.</p>\n<p>Pourquoi ? Parce que tout le monde s&rsquo;en moque. Nous l&rsquo;avons fait plusieurs fois et rien n&rsquo;a chang&eacute;. Et nous savons pourquoi.</p>\n<p>Lorsque votre site re&ccedil;oit 100 visiteurs par jour, faire des changements comme celui-ci n&rsquo;aura aucun impact. Pourquoi ? Votre &eacute;chantillon est trop petit, minuscule et insignifiant. Vous passez mieux votre temps &agrave; conduire 1000 visiteurs quotidiens vers votre page d&rsquo;accueil et &agrave; faire des changements quand cela a du sens. Quand votre &eacute;chantillon devient assez grand, c&rsquo;est le bon moment pour faire des tests CRO.</p>\n<h2>12. Votre Faiblesse Peut &Ecirc;tre Votre Plus Grande Opportunit&eacute; &ndash; Adaptez-vous et Bougez Rapidement</h2>\n<p>En tant que jeune entreprise avec une petite client&egrave;le et un manque de ressources, vous pourriez penser que vous &ecirc;tes faible et que vos concurrents vous d&eacute;voreront.</p>\n<p>Faux. Le fait d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre petit par rapport &agrave; eux peut &ecirc;tre un &eacute;norme avantage. Qu&rsquo;est-ce que je veux dire ? Vos concurrents ont des milliers de clients et une infrastructure robuste. Mais ils ont aussi beaucoup de r&egrave;glements d&rsquo;entreprise et d&rsquo;&eacute;tapes &agrave; suivre avant d&rsquo;apporter des changements.</p>\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width: 854px"><img src="https://kinsta.com/fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/11/adapter.jpeg" alt="S''adapter et se d&eacute;placer rapidement" width="854" height="480"><p class="wp-caption-text">S&rsquo;adapter et se d&eacute;placer rapidement (Img src : <a href="https://www.vg247.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VG 24/7</a>)</p></div>\n<p>Habituellement, il leur faut des mois, voire plus, pour impl&eacute;menter une demande de fonctionnalit&eacute;, apporter une modification &agrave; l&rsquo;interface utilisateur ou impl&eacute;menter un modulle, ce qui est crucial pour nombre de leurs clients. Mais vos mains ne sont pas li&eacute;es par des politiques d&rsquo;entreprise ou une grande infrastructure, ce qui signifie que vous pouvez agir rapidement et d&eacute;ployer les changements rapidement.</p>\n<p>Quand la premi&egrave;re version de PHP 7 pr&ecirc;te pour la production est sortie, nous l&rsquo;avons mise &agrave; la disposition de nos clients en quelques jours ! L&rsquo;actualit&eacute; de l&rsquo;industrie portait sur les avantages de la mise &agrave; jour vers PHP 7 et elle &eacute;tait d&eacute;j&agrave; disponible sur notre plateforme. Pour la plupart des grands de notre industrie, il a fallu plus d&rsquo;un an pour la rendre disponible pour leurs clients (beaucoup ne l&rsquo;ont pas encore ajout&eacute; ou ne l&rsquo;ont rendu disponible que pour les offres d&rsquo;entreprise sup&eacute;rieures, ce qui n&rsquo;a aucun sens).</p>\n<p>Je peux vous dire qu&rsquo;en impl&eacute;mentant ce petit changement, o&ugrave; vous pouvez passer de PHP 5.6 &agrave; PHP 7 <a href="https://kinsta.com/fr/base-de-connaissances/mettre-a-jour-version-php-wordpress/">en cliquant sur un seul bouton</a>, nous avons g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute; beaucoup de nouvelles affaires.</p>\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width: 1573px"><img src="https://kinsta.com/fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/06/mise-jour-version-php-site-wordpress.png" alt="Mise &agrave; jour de la version PHP du site WordPress" width="1573" height="1156"><p class="wp-caption-text">Mise &agrave; jour de la version PHP du site WordPress</p></div>\n<p>Cette petite fonctionnalit&eacute; est le moteur d&rsquo;un grand nombre d&rsquo;affaires. Les agences web avec de gros <a href="https://kinsta.com/fr/blog/extensions-wordpress-portfolio/">portfolios</a> sont pass&eacute;s de nos concurrents &agrave; nous. Pourquoi ? Parce que nous avons &eacute;t&eacute; en mesure d&rsquo;agir rapidement et de rendre cette fonctionnalit&eacute; disponible. Bref, le <strong>fait d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre petit a aussi ses avantages, il suffit de voir les choses d&rsquo;une autre fa&ccedil;on</strong>.</p>\n<h2>13. R&eacute;seau. Faites-vous des Amis. Aidez les Autres. Et Agitez-vous.</h2>\n<p>Quel que soit votre secteur d&rsquo;activit&eacute;, je parie qu&rsquo;il y a beaucoup d&rsquo;experts, d&rsquo;influenceurs et de blogueurs avec lesquels vous devriez, voulez et devez vous connecter. Vous devez faire partie de cette communaut&eacute; et vous faire autant d&rsquo;amis que possible. Vous pouvez discuter des derniers changements de l&rsquo;industrie, aider &agrave; r&eacute;soudre des probl&egrave;mes auxquels l&rsquo;un d&rsquo;entre vous a peut-&ecirc;tre d&eacute;j&agrave; fait face, recommander des outils, des techniques de marketing, des services ou des personnes avec qui travailler, etc.</p>\n<p>Malheureusement, nous n&rsquo;aidons pas les autres autant que nous le pourrions. Nous avons tous des objectifs personnels et un emploi du temps charg&eacute; &agrave; chaque minute de la journ&eacute;e. Mais il est tr&egrave;s important d&rsquo;&eacute;tablir des relations en aidant les autres. Partagez vos connaissances et votre expertise, donnez des conseils sur des sujets qui vous sont familiers et que vous connaissez bien, partagez vos ressources et vos donn&eacute;es si possible, partagez d&rsquo;autres contenus sur les r&eacute;seaux sociaux ou incluez-les dans votre bulletin. Ces petites bonnes actions vous reviendront au d&eacute;cuple.</p>\n<p><strong>Chaque homme est l&rsquo;architecte de sa propre fortune</strong>. Peut-&ecirc;tre avez-vous pr&eacute;vu d&rsquo;envoyer 20 e-mails froids super personnalis&eacute;s et cibl&eacute;s cette semaine ? Envoyez-en 30. Envoyez-en 40 la semaine prochaine. Connectez-vous &agrave; plus d&rsquo;un influenceur sur les r&eacute;seaux sociaux. Am&eacute;liorez votre productivit&eacute; globale de seulement 1% par semaine et &agrave; la fin de l&rsquo;ann&eacute;e, cela aura un impact &eacute;norme. Soyez actif sur Twitter et tendez la main &agrave; tous les blogs pertinents de votre industrie et assurez-vous qu&rsquo;ils savent que vous existez.</p>\n<p>Gary Vaynerchuk aurait pu prendre sa retraite il y a de nombreuses ann&eacute;es, mais il fait le contraire. Il est super actif sur les r&eacute;seaux sociaux, g&egrave;re un blog et un podcast quotidiens sur YouTube, donne activement des conseils, vous envoie des tweets, dirige son entreprise m&eacute;dia et d&rsquo;autres entreprises. Et <a href="https://twitter.com/garyvee/status/858878581547642881?lang=en">s&rsquo;agiter un dimanche soir</a> n&rsquo;est pas un probl&egrave;me pour lui.

Je ne crois pas, non.</p>\n<h2>14. Automatisez, Automatisez et Automatisez Encore Plus</h2>\n<p>Lorsqu&rsquo;il s&rsquo;agit de faire passer votre entreprise au niveau sup&eacute;rieur, l&rsquo;un des points cl&eacute;s est de savoir comment vous pouvez g&eacute;rer l&rsquo;int&eacute;r&ecirc;t accru pour vos demandes de service et de support. Ce qui est bien, c&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;il existe un grand nombre d&rsquo;outils, d&rsquo;applications et de services que vous pouvez int&eacute;grer et qui permettent de g&eacute;rer une base d&rsquo;utilisateurs &eacute;norme avec une &eacute;quipe relativement petite.</p>\n<p>Chez Kinsta, nous utilisons beaucoup d&rsquo;<a href="https://kinsta.com/fr/blog/produits-saas/">outils SaaS</a> pour nous faciliter la vie, et nous avons int&eacute;gr&eacute; de nombreux services tiers pour g&eacute;rer diff&eacute;rentes t&acirc;ches qui nous aident &agrave; lib&eacute;rer la charge de travail humaine. Les machines sont parfaites lorsqu&rsquo;il s&rsquo;agit de t&acirc;ches monotones, parce qu&rsquo;elles font rarement une erreur et peuvent accomplir les t&acirc;ches de mani&egrave;re beaucoup plus rapide et rentable. Mais vous devez d&rsquo;abord r&eacute;soudre ces t&acirc;ches et probl&egrave;mes manuellement pour obtenir des informations cruciales sur la fa&ccedil;on dont ils doivent &ecirc;tre r&eacute;solus.</p>\n<p>Au fil des ann&eacute;es, nous avons automatis&eacute; tellement de choses qu&rsquo;il serait difficile de les mentionner toutes dans cette section, mais en voici quelques-unes :</p>\n<ul><li>Gr&acirc;ce &agrave; Intercom, nous avons automatis&eacute; la plupart de nos messages d&rsquo;accueil et d&rsquo;embarquement.</li>\n<li>Nous envoyons automatiquement des e-mails lorsque votre paiement a &eacute;chou&eacute;.</li>\n<li>Vous recevez un e-mail lorsque votre carte bancaire est sur le point d&rsquo;expirer</li>\n<li>Vous &ecirc;tes automatiquement avis&eacute; lorsque votre offre annuelle est sur le point d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre renouvel&eacute;e.</li>\n<li>Notre syst&egrave;me v&eacute;rifie le volume des e-mails transactionnels sortants, donc s&rsquo;il se passe quelque chose, il avertit nos administrateurs syst&egrave;me.</li>\n<li>La charge du serveur est v&eacute;rifi&eacute;e automatiquement pour maintenir des performances maximales.</li>\n<li>Automatisation et simplification des t&acirc;ches les plus lourdes de support, comme la cr&eacute;ation de mise en test de site web, le passe de test en production, la cr&eacute;ation et le renouvellement de SSL, l&rsquo;interrogation des journaux d&rsquo;erreurs sur le tableau de bord, etc.</li>\n<li>Et 42 autres t&acirc;ches rien qu&rsquo;en 2017</li>\n</ul><p>Les utilisateurs adorent interagir avec de vrais humains, surtout s&rsquo;ils paient pour votre service. Cela signifie donc aussi que vous ne devez pas tout automatiser. Mais vous devriez automatiser toutes les t&acirc;ches qui peuvent &ecirc;tre accomplies par une solution bas&eacute;e sur un code ou programmable. Si vous ne le faites pas, votre base d&rsquo;utilisateurs augmentera plus vite que vous ne pouvez embaucher de nouveaux ing&eacute;nieurs et du personnel de support pour maintenir la qualit&eacute; de votre service.</p>\n<h2>15. Les Gros Titres Brillants ne Refl&egrave;tent pas la R&eacute;alit&eacute;</h2>\n<p>Lorsque vous suivez Techcrunch, VentureBeat ou TNW, vous pourriez penser qu&rsquo;il est facile de b&acirc;tir une entreprise. D&rsquo;innombrables manchettes disant que &laquo;&nbsp;X&nbsp;&raquo; a rapport&eacute; des millions, &laquo;&nbsp;Z&nbsp;&raquo; a &eacute;t&eacute; acquis par &laquo;&nbsp;Y&nbsp;&raquo;, et XZ a doubl&eacute; son chiffre d&rsquo;affaires, sa base d&rsquo;utilisateurs et sa client&egrave;le au cours des 12 derniers mois.</p>\n<p>Nous aimons lire et partager les histoires de r&eacute;ussite. Mais n&rsquo;oublions pas que ces histoires ne portent g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement que sur les r&eacute;sultats, les grands nombres obtenus. Ils ne mentionnent presque jamais les ann&eacute;es de travail acharn&eacute; derri&egrave;re ce succ&egrave;s. Le nombre incalculable d&rsquo;heures de travail, tous les b&eacute;n&eacute;fices r&eacute;investis, les sacrifices personnels, les nuits blanches, les &eacute;puisements, les probl&egrave;mes de sant&eacute;, etc.</p>\n<p>Ce que je veux dire ici, c&rsquo;est que les <strong>m&eacute;dias sont souvent unilat&eacute;raux</strong> et que nous pourrions avoir l&rsquo;impression qu&rsquo;il est plus facile que jamais de b&acirc;tir une entreprise &agrave; partir de z&eacute;ro. C&rsquo;est vrai pour d&eacute;marrer une entreprise, mais c&rsquo;est en la transformant en entreprise que le travail commence. Vous aurez des hauts et des bas tout le temps, mais le travail acharn&eacute; rapporte et est r&eacute;compens&eacute;. L&rsquo;image ci-dessous illustre parfaitement &agrave; quoi ressemble la vie d&rsquo;un entrepreneur :</p>\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width: 847px"><img src="https://kinsta.com/fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/11/vie-entrepreneur.png" alt="Vie d''entrepreneur" width="847" height="260"><p class="wp-caption-text">Vie d&rsquo;entrepreneur (Img src : <a href="https://baremetrics.com/blog/long-slow-saas-ramp-of-death" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baremetrics</a>)</p></div>\n<p>La voie du succ&egrave;s n&rsquo;est pas droite. C&rsquo;est un autre grand tweet d&rsquo;un c&eacute;l&egrave;bre sp&eacute;cialiste du marketing et entrepreneur en ligne Noah Kagan. Il ne s&rsquo;agit pas ici de s&rsquo;enrichir, mais plut&ocirc;t des ann&eacute;es de travail acharn&eacute; qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; n&eacute;cessaires.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here''s an easy way to get rich.

Trouvez-vous un Hobby. S&eacute;rieusement.</h2>\n<p>Si vous passez la majeure partie de votre journ&eacute;e devant un ordinateur, vous pouvez vous &eacute;puiser assez rapidement. Quelques longs mois plus tard, vous vous retrouverez d&eacute;motiv&eacute; et moins efficace. Si vous &ecirc;tes passionn&eacute; par votre entreprise, vous connaissez ce sentiment parce que vous pensez &agrave; votre prochain coup, reportage, campagne de marketing 24/7. Vous &ecirc;tes excit&eacute; et ne soyez pas surpris quand votre startup est un artiste fr&eacute;quent dans vos r&ecirc;ves.</p>\n<p>Mais n&rsquo;oubliez pas qu&rsquo;&agrave; l&rsquo;occasion vous avez besoin d&rsquo;arr&ecirc;ter ce type de r&eacute;flexion et de passer du temps avec une activit&eacute; totalement diff&eacute;rente. <strong>Votre cerveau a besoin de temps d&rsquo;arr&ecirc;t</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://kinsta.com/fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/11/downtime.gif" alt="downtime" width="500" height="313"></p>\n<p>Cela vous aidera &agrave; recharger votre cerveau, &agrave; rester alerte, et les meilleures id&eacute;es viennent g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement d&rsquo;un environnement diff&eacute;rent (ouais, <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/why-we-have-our-best-ideas-in-the-shower-the-science-of-creativity">l&rsquo;effet douche</a>).</p>\n<p>Si vous avez d&eacute;j&agrave; un passe-temps, c&rsquo;est g&eacute;nial ! Sinon, je vous conseille d&rsquo;en trouver un. Peu importe le genre de passe-temps, assurez-vous simplement que vous pouvez le pratiquer r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement, c&rsquo;est amusant et cela peut vous aider &agrave; vous d&eacute;connecter de l&rsquo;entreprise. Les pauses mentales augmentent la productivit&eacute;, l&rsquo;attention et encouragent la cr&eacute;ativit&eacute;.</p>\n<p>Par exemple, je collectionne des livres anciens depuis l&rsquo;&acirc;ge de 16 ans. J&rsquo;en sais beaucoup sur eux, je suis en contact avec beaucoup de collectionneurs et c&rsquo;est assez difficile de trouver un livre vieux de 120 ans qui n&rsquo;a &eacute;t&eacute; imprim&eacute; qu&rsquo;en 100 exemplaires. Mais c&rsquo;est amusant et tr&egrave;s agr&eacute;able de pouvoir constituer sa collection avec un volume rare.</p>\n<h2>Grand Merci</h2>\n<p>Un <strong>grand merci &agrave; tous nos clients</strong> ! &#128079; Vous &ecirc;tes tous g&eacute;niaux et sans votre soutien, Kinsta ne serait pas l&agrave;.</p>\n<p>Et aux cr&eacute;ateurs de WordPress et aux membres de la communaut&eacute; ; sans vous, il ne serait pas possible de cr&eacute;er des sites web exceptionnels.
